          Born in San Francisco, I studied computer science at the University of
          California, Merced from 2018 to 2022. During that time, I gained a
          passion for UI/UX and full-stack software development. Since my first
          time coding with HTML in the fall of 2019, Iâ€™ve designed and coded
          many web applications using React, CSS/Sass, Flask, and Spring Boot.
          In addition, in February 2022, I started developing Android
          applications with Java.

          <br></br>
          Outside of full-stack software development, I like to program with
          Java, Python, and C++, in addition to learning more about operating
          systems, computer networks, database internals, and game development.
